### Disable services
You can disable services of your Synology accessory. Add a `disabled` property with an array to your config.json. You can add the following parameters:
- `temp` to disable the temperature
- `stats` to disable the custom characeristics cpu load and disk usage quote.
- `switch` to disable shutting down the Synology. 

**Note** This accessory will only appear as switch at the Apple Home App. Use the EVE App instead to get all services.

### Two factor authentification (2FA)
This plugin does not support 2FA. If you have enabled 2FA, you can't use this plugin.

## Functions
- wake up (wake-on-lan has to be active) your diskstation
- shutdown your diskstation
- get the current system or average disk temperature
- get the current cpu load
- get the disk usage quote (it is the average usage if you have more than one volume)

## Issues
Please double check your config.json before opening an issue.
When you open an issue provide a detailed description of your problem and add your config.json (without password).

## Roadmap
- ~~Polling feature with ping~~
